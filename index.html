<h1>Anthony Li <span class="font-weight-light">Debate</span></h1>
<p>The one place for my cases, blocks, and disclosures.</p>

<h3 class="heading-muted mt-5">Current Disclosures</h3>
<div class="d-flex flex-wrap mb-3">
    {% assign seasons = site.seasons | sort:"order" %}
    {% for season in seasons %}
    {% assign url = "/debate" | append: season.url %}
    {% include link.html href=url title=season.title domain="View disclosures" %}
    {% endfor %}
</div>

<p>
    <strong>Why am I not disclosing on the wiki?</strong>
    I feel that while disclosure is a good thing, disclosure shouldn't be forced to happen on a specific website.
    Decentralization is a good thing, and should be a norm that we set in debate.
    This website is how I express that norm.
    <em>Expect theory if you contest this idea in a debate round.</em>
