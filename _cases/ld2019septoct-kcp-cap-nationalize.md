## K: Cap

#### The left’s focus on melancholia leaves it consigned to a cycle of unproductive and fractured repetition of capitalism. The aff links into this by performing a simplistic act of self-care without actually overcoming capitalism.
Dean, Jodi (Political theorist at the Hobart and William Smith Colleges). "Communist desire." The Ends of History. Routledge, 2013. 14-31. AS
> An emphasis on the drive ... different organization of social relationships.”

#### Capitalism is a system of hierarchization and commodification which justifies infinite exploitation
Kovel 2k-(Joel, American scholar and author, “The struggle for use value: Thoughts about the transition,” Capitalism Nature Socialism, June 1 2000, [http://pdfserve.informaworld.com/342658_731193540_909015405.pdf](http://pdfserve.informaworld.com/342658_731193540_909015405.pdf))
> For capital, the whole world ... endocrine destabilization, pandemic diseases, etc).

#### Imperialism is not only an economic issue but rather one of culture assimilation and the imposition of our values onto other cultures
Kofman and Youngs 3-(Eleonore and Gillian, “Globalization: theory and practice,” Continuum International Publishing, 2003)
> Although the above comments focus ... Klein’s (2000) call for ‘no logo.’

### Capitalism is the starting point for all of the world atrocities.
Herod ‘7 (James, Columbia U graduate and political activist, “Getting Free” Pg. 8-9 JF) - [http://site.www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Strate/GetFre/5thEd/PrintEd.rtf](http://site.www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Strate/GetFre/5thEd/PrintEd.rtf)
> Beyond these two basic awarenesses ... wish to study their works. 

#### Capitalism is linked to war. Capitalism needs war to exist for it to be able to thrive.
Campbell 14 – Campbell, Sally (Editor of Socialist Review). “Why does capitalism lead to war?” Socialist Review, September 2014. [http://socialistreview.org.uk/394/why-does-capitalism-lead-war](http://socialistreview.org.uk/394/why-does-capitalism-lead-war)
> The century since the slaughter ... defend any of these things.

#### The greatest ethical obligation is to resist capitalism because it’s relevant under any moral theory.
Morgaridge, Clayton, Prof of Philosophy at Lewis & Clark College, 1998, Why Capitalism is Evil 08/22 [http://www.lclark.edu/~clayton/commentaries/evil.html](http://www.lclark.edu/~clayton/commentaries/evil.html) 
> Now none of these philosophers ... a seat at the table.  

## Counterplan: The United States federal government ought to create a public system of universal nationalized standardized tests for the purpose of undergraduate college admissions.

#### Disregard towards students and bias towards the majority exists because standardized testing organizations lack government oversight and are now lobbying in the government.
AETR ’12. Americans for Educational Testing Reform. “Political Lobbying.” - [http://www.aetr.org/the-facts/political-lobbying/](http://www.aetr.org/the-facts/political-lobbying/) 
> The Big 3 spend hundreds of ... further lobbying of any sort.

#### To fix this, we must dismantle the College Board and other forms of private standardized tests; instead, the government must create its own form of college admissions test. Singapore, the top country on the OECD’s PISA index, proves this provides a fair and effective system:
Hogan ’14. Hogan, David (honorary professor at University of Queenland). “Why is Singapore’s school system so successful, and is it a model for the West?” The Conversation, February 11, 2014. - [https://theconversation.com/why-is-singapores-school-system-so-successful-and-is-it-a-model-for-the-west-22917](https://theconversation.com/why-is-singapores-school-system-so-successful-and-is-it-a-model-for-the-west-22917) 
> So Singapore’s teaching regime is ... and instruction is exceptionally strong. 

#### This solves by shifting the standardized testing system from the private sector to the public sector, in which the government is accountable to everyone.
Albert Shanker Institute. Albert Shanker Institute (institute for the promotion of democracy). “Accountability Principles.” Democracy Web, Albert Shanker Institute. - [https://democracyweb.org/accountability-principles](https://democracyweb.org/accountability-principles) 
> In a democracy, the principle ... to become arbitrary and self-serving.

#### A universal testing program, administered during school hours, will increase college attendance, solving the harms of the aff.
Dynarski, Susan (professor of public policy at the University of Michigan). "Simple Way To Help Low-Income Students: Make Everyone Take SAT Or ACT." The New York Times. July 14, 2017. Web. August 17, 2019. [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/upshot/how-universal-college-admission-tests-help-low-income-students.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/upshot/how-universal-college-admission-tests-help-low-income-students.html).
> Joshua M. Hyman, an assistant ... in Maine, Illinois and Colorado.

#### Through this, we can turn standardized tests into a real utopia:
Wright ’15. Wright, Erik Olin (professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin). “How to Be an Anticapitalist Today.” Jacobin, December 2, 2015. - [https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/12/erik-olin-wright-real-utopias-anticapitalism-democracy/](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/12/erik-olin-wright-real-utopias-anticapitalism-democracy/) 
> Real Utopia is a self-contradictory ... organized on a noncapitalist basis.
