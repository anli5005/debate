## Framework
The role of the ballot should be to resist structural violence.

#### Structural violence occurs when the structure of our society oppresses others. Thus, we must educate ourselves to think critically about structural oppression.
Farmer et al ’06 - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1621099/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1621099/) 
> Structural violence, a term coined by Johan Galtung and by liberation theologians during the 1960s, describes social structures—economic, political, legal, religious, and cultural—that stop individuals, groups, and societies from reaching their full potential [57]. In its general usage, the word violence often conveys a physical image; however, according to Galtung, it is the “avoidable impairment of fundamental human needs or…the impairment of human life, which lowers the actual degree to which someone is able to meet their needs below that which would otherwise be possible” [58]. Structural violence is often embedded in longstanding “ubiquitous social structures, normalized by stable institutions and regular experience” [59]. Because they seem so ordinary in our ways of understanding the world, they appear almost invisible. Disparate access to resources, political power, education, health care, and legal standing are just a few examples. The idea of structural violence is linked very closely to social injustice and the social machinery of oppression [16].

#### We must solve structural violence first because we cannot form a coherent moral code if we are excluding others from our moral sphere.
Winter & Leighton '01 - [http://sites.saumag.edu/danaleighton/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/09/SVintro-2.pdf](http://sites.saumag.edu/danaleighton/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/09/SVintro-2.pdf)
> Finally, to recognize the operation of structural violence forces us to ask questions about how and why we tolerate it, questions which often have painful answers for the privi- leged elite who unconsciously support it. A final question of this section is how and why we allow ourselves to be so oblivious to structural violence. Susan Opotow offers an intriguing set of answers, in her article Social Injustice. She argues that our normal perceptual/cognitive processes divide people into in-groups and out-groups. Those outside our group lie outside our scope of justice. Injustice that would be instantane- ously confronted if it occurred to someone we love or know is barely noticed if it occurs to strangers or those who are invisible or irrelevant. We do not seem to be able to open our minds and our hearts to everyone, so we draw conceptual lines between those who are in and out of our moral circle. Those who fall outside are morally excluded, and be- come either invisible, or demeaned in some way so that we do not have to acknowledge the injustice they suffer. Moral exclusion is a human failing, but Opotow argues con- vincingly that it is an outcome of everyday social cognition. To reduce its nefarious effects, we must be vigilant in noticing and listening to oppressed, invisible, outsiders. Inclusionary thinking can be fostered by relationships, communication, and apprecia- tion of diversity.

## Disad: Grade Inflation

#### College campuses are more diverse than ever
AAC&U 19 (Association of American Colleges & Universities, AAC&U News, March 2019 “College Students Are More Diverse Than Ever. Faculty and Administrators Are Not”, [https://www.aacu.org/aacu-news/newsletter/2019/march/facts-figures](https://www.aacu.org/aacu-news/newsletter/2019/march/facts-figures)) (Vikram)
> The student population in US ... the academy remain “predominantly white.”

#### When colleges don't have test scores, they weigh GPA heavily - test-optional colleges prove.
Simon 15 ((Cecilia Capuzzi Simon, Writer) “The Test-Optional Surge”, NYT, Oct. 28, 2015, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/education/edlife/the-test-optional-surge.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/education/edlife/the-test-optional-surge.html)) (Vikram)
> Applying test-optional is not an ... not be working to potential.

#### Rampant GPA inflation favors rich, white kids over poor kids in urban districts
Marcus 17 ((Jon Marcus is the higher-education editor at The Hechinger Report.) “Why Suburban Schools Are Inflating Kids' Grades,” Atlantic, 8-16-2017, [https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/08/suburban-grade-inflation/536595/](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/08/suburban-grade-inflation/536595/)) (Vikram)
> PITTSBURGH—Monet Spencer remembers traveling ... applicants whose GPAs are highest.

#### Abolishing the SAT doesn’t solve the underlying conditions behind the disparities. The SAT functions as an equalizer, even if it is flawed.
Deboer 18 ((Freddie Deboer, ) “The SAT Can Level the Playing Field in Education,” People’s Policy Project, 3-20-2018, [https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2018/03/20/the-sat-can-level-the-playing-field-in-education/](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2018/03/20/the-sat-can-level-the-playing-field-in-education/)) (Vikram)
> The SAT does not enjoy ... way that should disturb us.

#### The result is *less* racial minorities and economically disadvantaged people at college– leads to cycles of poverty
Cunningham 17 ((Peter Cunningham is the founder of Education Post and serves on its board. He served as assistant secretary for communications and outreach in the U.S. Department of Education during the Obama administration. Prior to that he led communications for Chicago Public Schools) “Education Is the Surest Path Out of Poverty, Even If The Atlantic Reports Otherwise,” Education Post, 10-9-2017, [https://educationpost.org/education-is-the-surest-path-out-of-poverty-even-if-the-atlantic-reports-otherwise/](https://educationpost.org/education-is-the-surest-path-out-of-poverty-even-if-the-atlantic-reports-otherwise/)) (Vikram)

## Counterplan: The United States federal government ought to create a public system of nationalized standardized tests.
Such a standardized test would be administered universally and free-of-charge.

#### This disregard towards students and bias towards the majority exists because they lack government oversight and are lobbying.
AETR '12 - [http://www.aetr.org/the-facts/political-lobbying/](http://www.aetr.org/the-facts/political-lobbying/)
> The Big 3 spend hundreds of thousands of dollars every year on political lobbying designed to strengthen their monopolies. Each of them admits to the IRS that their huge expenditures were designed "to influence national, state, or local legislation, includ[ing] any attempt to influence public opinion on a legislative matter or referendum." Almost all of the money is spent "to influence a legislative body (direct lobbying)." As it turns out, most of these lobbying expenditures are made to solidify their existing monopoly positions and even generate new ones. In the past, they have even lobbied to maintain their unethical "guinea pig testing" policies, where test-takers are forced to participate in difficult research programs in the middle of their actual exams. Direct lobbying is one of the ugliest features of American government. Time and again, it has allowed corporations to pay legislators and government officials for favors and preferential treatment. For the Big 3, the only difference is that they are a step ahead of the private sector; they are already government-endorsed monoplies whose customers are required (by universities, school districts, etc.) to purchase their products. They don't need to be influencing legislators with their monopoly earnings. The Big 3 are engaged in precisely the kind of political manipulation America doesn't need, and to the tune of millions of dollars. They should be prohibited from further lobbying of any sort.

#### To fix this, we must dismantle the College Board and other private standardized tests. Instead, we must move standardized tests from private to public ownership. Singapore, the top country on the OECD's PISA index, proves that government control provides a fair and effective system.
Hogan '14 - [https://theconversation.com/why-is-singapores-school-system-so-successful-and-is-it-a-model-for-the-west-22917](https://theconversation.com/why-is-singapores-school-system-so-successful-and-is-it-a-model-for-the-west-22917)
> So Singapore’s teaching regime is one primarily focused on the transmission of conventional curriculum knowledge and examination performance. And clearly it is highly-effective, helping to generate outstanding results in international assessments Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Singapore’s education system is the product of a distinctive, even unique, set of historical, institutional and cultural influences. These factors go a long way to help explain why the educational system is especially effective in the current assessment environment, but it also limits how transferable it is to other countries. Over time, Singapore has developed a powerful set of institutional arrangements that shape its instructional regime. Singapore has developed an education system which is centralised (despite significant decentralisation of authority in recent years), integrated, coherent and well-funded. It is also relatively flexible and expert-led. In addition, Singapore’s institutional arrangements is characterised by a prescribed national curriculum. National high stakes examinations at the end of primary and secondary schooling stream students according to their exam performance and, crucially, prompt teachers to emphasise coverage of the curriculum and teaching to the test. The alignment of curriculum, assessment and instruction is exceptionally strong. 

#### This solves by shifting the standardized testing system from the private sector to the public sector, in which the government is accountable to everyone.

#### Administering admissions tests universally and free-of-charge solves the aff.
Dynarski, Susan. "Simple Way To Help Low-Income Students: Make Everyone Take SAT Or ACT." The New York Times. July 14, 2017. Web. August 17, 2019. [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/upshot/how-universal-college-admission-tests-help-low-income-students.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/upshot/how-universal-college-admission-tests-help-low-income-students.html)
> There is widespread concern about over-testing in schools. Yet we need all students to take the right tests if low-income and minority children are to have a good shot at a quality college education. The two standard college admission tests — the SAT and the ACT — could be administered universally and free of charge to students. That would reduce the administrative barriers to applying to college, help identify talented disadvantaged children, and increase the likelihood that they will attend a college that matches their skills. 

Susan continues,
