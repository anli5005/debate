The role of the ballot should be to vote for the debater who best demonstrates procedural resistance to structural violence.

> Arab observers also point out ... instability in the Middle East.

#### Link: FMS Sales include bulldozers. Bulldozers facilitates the worst forms of settler colonialism and urbicide.

#### Scenario 1 is Ethnic Cleansing-Ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people is an impact magnifier: it makes war, deterioration of international relations and conflict more likely. This underpins state violence. Prefer our evidence-its contextual.
