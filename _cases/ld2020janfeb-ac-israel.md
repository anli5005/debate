## FW: Structural Violence
The role of the ballot should be to vote for the debater who best demonstrates procedural resistance to structural violence.

#### Structural violence is the worst form of violence and causes all other forms of violence.

Trained in medicine and psychiatry at Yale and Harvard Universities, and in medical anthropology as a fellow of the National Institute of Mental Health, she is currently on the faculty of Yale School of Medicine’s Law and Psychiatry Division).

### Advantage 1: Bulldozers

#### Israeli nuclear weapons cause regional destabilization and serve as easy targets for Arab militaries.
Maoz ’03. Zeev Maoz (UC Davis, Professor of Political Science, Director of the Correlates of War Project), International Security Vol. 28, No. 2 (Fall, 2003), pp. 44-77, “The Mixed Blessing of Israel’s Nuclear Policy.” JSTOR, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4137468](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4137468)

#### Uniqueness: Israeli nukes create arms races that artificially creates their desire for US military aid.

> Arab observers also point out ... instability in the Middle East.

#### Link: FMS Sales include bulldozers. Bulldozers facilitates the worst forms of settler colonialism and urbicide.

#### Scenario 1 is Ethnic Cleansing-Ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people is an impact magnifier: it makes war, deterioration of international relations and conflict more likely. This underpins state violence. Prefer our evidence-its contextual.
